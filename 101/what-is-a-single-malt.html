    <h1>What's a Single Malt?</h1>
    
  </header>
  <p>"Single malt" can mean different things. Most often it's short for "single malt Scotch whisky".</p>
<p><em>Single</em> means that it's made from the whisky of a single distillery as opposed to a blend, which comes from many distilleries. A single <em>malt</em> means a drink made from malted grain, usually barley. In the case of single malt Scotch whisky, the grain is always malted barley.</p>
<p><em>Scotch whisky</em> is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotch_Whisky_Regulations_2009">regulated</a>, and is only allowed to be sold as Scotch whisky if it meets certain criteria. Some of the more interesting criteria are that it has to be made and <em>aged</em> in Scotland for at least three years, have a minimum alcohol percentage of 40%, and can't have anything added before bottling except for water and caramel colouring.</p>
<p>That last requirement is a bit of a controversy. Many malts pride themselves on using no colouring whatsoever. Colouring is controversial because it is unneccessary and tarnishes what is otherwise a completely naturally-produced product. Colouring doesn't ruin a whisky, though. One of our mainstays, the Highland Park 12, is so dark that it must be coloured to some degree.</p>
<p>Single malts can have different vintages combined together to produce the whisky, but only the youngest can be claimed on the bottle. For example, a 10 year old whisky will often have older vintages mixed in to provide a consistent, year over year flavour, but must advertise itself as a 10 year old. Because of this practice, and definitely unlike wine, whiskies bottled this year is not much different than those from any other recent year.</p>
<p>Single malts do not need to be made from a single cask. Whiskies made from a single cask are called that: Single cask. Often a cask number will be printed on the label. These are are very restrictive subcategory within single malts, and can vary much more in flavour, as casks have some element of individuality. These are more akin to wine vintages in their variation and the fact that once they're all gone, there's no way to reproduce them.</p>
<p>In general, when someone speaks of <em>single malts</em>, they're abbreviating <em>Single Malt Scotch Whisky</em>. Sorry, Irish whiskies, but it's true.</p>
