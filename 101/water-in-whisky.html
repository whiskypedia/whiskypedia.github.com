    <h1>Water In Whisky?</h1>
    
  </header>
  <p>It's one of the polarizing whisky questions: should you put water in your whisky? Each side often demonizes the other. Clearly, one side would say, the "waterers" are the spineless poseurs of the whisky world, and likely drink Zima when no one is watching. Just as clearly, the "no-waterers" are only into whisky as a socially acceptable analog to beating one's chest like an ape, and likely have scars on their foreheads from all the beer can crushing they did in college.</p>
<p>We can treat each in turn.</p>
<h1>The Case For Watered</h1>
<p>Properly watering down a single malt involves carefully adding a few drops per ounce. This is not a blast from a bartender's soda fountain, it's a controlled dilution. Grab a small coffee spoon, and fill the bottom until it's about the size of a dime. If you're without a spoon, you can pour a small amount from a water bottle into its cap. Never pour from straight from a bottle — the odds favour over-pouring.</p>
<p>And remember to water it after you've already had a taste. Otherwise you're never going to know if it benefitted.</p>
<p>Watering a malt affects both the nose and taste. You can go back to the nose, and you're likely to get some more subtle aromas. It's the same on the palate: you should get fewer of the <em>big</em> flavours like sherry, peat, or iodine. The goal is to let the more subtle flavours come to the surface.</p>
<p>Another benefit of water is to adjust the concentration of cask strength malts. Some cask strengths are <a href="/reviews/aberlour-abunadh.html">perfectly drinkable</a> at 60%. Some … really aren't. Adding some water can remove an overpowering burn to bring out some actual underlying flavour.</p>
<h1>The Case For Straight</h1>
<p>There are also few reasons to stay away from water. The first is that any given bottle of single malt scotch whisky is going to be drinkable, all on its own. Bottlers are painstaking about delivering a high quality product. If you don't like the taste, the water isn't going to change that, but the quality level of today's single malts are unimpeachable.</p>
<p>Another reason is that water is a crapshoot. Some single malts are actually worse with water. Some bottlings, often the milder speysides or lowland malts, lose the last of their fragile flavours with water. Some lose flavour but keep their burn, which is the exact opposite of the waterer's promise.</p>
<p>Lastly, you can't take water out of a glass. If you overwater, you can ruin the drink. You don't want to have to add three fingers of your favourite single malt just to get the conentration back to drinkable. Not being wasteful of single malts is just about the only moral principle everyone agrees on.</p>
<h1>The Middle Ground</h1>
<p>We don't ascribe fully to either of these extremes. We learned to drink single malts with dozens of kilt-wearing Scottish ex-pats, and most had no problem putting a drop of water in the odd glass. After all, the malt only got to 40% alcohol in the bottle because the bottler already watered it down that far. There is no magic about the concentration of whisky in the bottle: it's set by law in different countries, and engineered carefully by dilution.</p>
<p>But there's no point to water for its own sake. If a malt will benefit from it, then it's a good choice. And the only way to tell is to try it out. But after that first try, you should know if the whisky is one you're going to want to put water in.</p>
<p>The only behaviour we would find strange is to <em>always</em> or <em>never</em> put water in a malt. If you're dogmatic about it, you're going to miss out on the times when the grass really is greener on the other side of the fence.</p>
