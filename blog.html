    <h1><a href="/blog/2012/04/an-unlikely-hobby.html">An Unlikely Hobby</a></h1>
    
  </header>
  <p>If you tell someone you drink whisky for a hobby, at the very least you'll get a sly smile or a chuckle. It's the same sort of look you'd shoot someone if they said their hobby was off-track betting on horses. Of course we're not alcoholics at Whiskypedia, but we do have more 750ml bottles in the cupboard than most.</p>
<p>There are a couple of reasons why I consider whisky drinking a hobby, rather than an affliction: <em>collection</em> and <em>discernment</em>.</p>
<p>One of the first stages of the single malt whisky hobby is to realize the huge breadth of flavour among whiskies. Like other hobbies involving collections, this phase is categorized by <em>acquisition</em>. You want to sample all the different flavours on offer, to categorize them, and to judge them. Like coins or stamps, once you get over the breadth, you go searching for the rare and the prized. Individual whisky collections often have themes: some collect good value for money, some collect region or flavour, some collect rare malts, while some collect only from independent or mothballed distilleries.</p>
<p>If the goal was merely intoxication, any sufficiently inebriating liquor would do. But there isn't a single malt drinker out there who can't pick favourites. A whisky drinker has <em>discernment</em> about the malts they praise. Not everyone will agree: some value smoothness, others value boldness, but each will have a preference, and will work to identify the attributes that affect their enjoyment the most. It's this identification that elevates a mere preference into a discerning choice. Discernment is about understanding and articulating what makes a whisky more palatable relative to others.</p>
<p>It's unfortunate that alcohol is abused so widely. Just as the high rate of highway deaths colours "sport driving" on public roads, so too will alcoholism affect perception of whisky drinking as a hobby. It's up to each of us to represent our hobby responsibly.</p>
<p><em>(As our own little contribution to temperance, we've decided not to have any more Four Review Thursdays. They rarely produced more than 2 reviews, in any case.)</em></p>

  <p>Welcome to our humble spot on the Internet, where single malts are enjoyed and demystified. Blends are enjoyed too, but you're not supposed to admit that.</p>
<h2>Why Are We Here</h2>
<p>There are several reasons that we're writing this site. They're all correct, even though none are the single reason:</p>
<p>We got tired of snooty whisky reviews claiming all sorts of smells, tastes, and experiences that no regular person would ever taste.</p>
<p>We got annoyed by whisky snobs, who would like to keep single malts only available to the "initiated".</p>
<p>We wanted to give some sort of justification to the continued abuse of our livers.</p>
<p>It's all of these, and more.</p>
<h2>Real Reviews For Real People</h2>
<p>So we're going into the depths of malt whiskies, and we're going to write reviews that regular people would recognize. We want people to buy a malt and know what they're actually getting. We'd like people to be able to pick a small stable of whiskies to be prepared for all occasions.</p>
<p>We want to demystify the world of whisky, especially single malt Scotch whisky.</p>
