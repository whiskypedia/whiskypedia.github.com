    <h1><a href="/blog/2012/04/an-unlikely-hobby.html">An Unlikely Hobby</a></h1>
    
  </header>
  <p>If you tell someone you drink whisky for a hobby, at the very least you'll get a sly smile or a chuckle. It's the same sort of look you'd shoot someone if they said their hobby was off-track betting on horses. Of course we're not alcoholics at Whiskypedia, but we do have more 750ml bottles in the cupboard than most.</p>
<p>There are a couple of reasons why I consider whisky drinking a hobby, rather than an affliction: <em>collection</em> and <em>discernment</em>.</p>
<p>One of the first stages of the single malt whisky hobby is to realize the huge breadth of flavour among whiskies. Like other hobbies involving collections, this phase is categorized by <em>acquisition</em>. You want to sample all the different flavours on offer, to categorize them, and to judge them. Like coins or stamps, once you get over the breadth, you go searching for the rare and the prized. Individual whisky collections often have themes: some collect good value for money, some collect region or flavour, some collect rare malts, while some collect only from independent or mothballed distilleries.</p>
<p>If the goal was merely intoxication, any sufficiently inebriating liquor would do. But there isn't a single malt drinker out there who can't pick favourites. A whisky drinker has <em>discernment</em> about the malts they praise. Not everyone will agree: some value smoothness, others value boldness, but each will have a preference, and will work to identify the attributes that affect their enjoyment the most. It's this identification that elevates a mere preference into a discerning choice. Discernment is about understanding and articulating what makes a whisky more palatable relative to others.</p>
<p>It's unfortunate that alcohol is abused so widely. Just as the high rate of highway deaths colours "sport driving" on public roads, so too will alcoholism affect perception of whisky drinking as a hobby. It's up to each of us to represent our hobby responsibly.</p>
<p><em>(As our own little contribution to temperance, we've decided not to have any more Four Review Thursdays. They rarely produced more than 2 reviews, in any case.)</em></p>

      <p>Amarone is a neat gimmick. Fine to taste once and move on. Save some money and buy the 10 year old instead.</p>
    </div>
    
    
      </div>
    
  
  <p>This is <a href="/reviews/glen-arran-port-finish.html">another</a> in Glen Arran's line of uniquely finished bottlings. Like the others, it's semi-cask strength at 50%. It's got a bit of a bite, but the finish is strong enough to compete with that extra alcohol.</p>
<p>If you're not into wine, I'll bring you up to speed. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amarone">Amarone</a> is a full-bodied Italian red wine. It's a favourite with steaks and other big, meaty foods.</p>
<p>The Amarone finish does add some sweetness but not as much as sherry. Sherried malts generally have a long, warm finish, but the Amarone behaves more like a dry wine. It's somewhat tart and then dries up on the palate much quicker than you'd expect. I don't know how to describe it because it's closer to a wine effect than a whisky effect.</p>
<p>It's also impossible to drink this whole line of Glen Arran without getting the impression that it's all gimmickry. It's beautifully executed gimmickry, but that doesn't make it any better. We've faulted malts for using sherry as a crutch to provide all their flavour, and these exotic finishes are no better. It becomes all about the finish. We get worked up because Glen Arran whiskies don't need gimmicks to be world-class single malts.</p>
<p>There's little else to say about this malt once the finish has been covered. The finish makes it a one trick pony. Of course, it's a hell of a trick, and like nothing you're going to get elsewhere.  It's not going to taste like any other single malt, so it's worth a try on that basis alone. But it's not going to be a staple for many.</p>
<p>It's hard to describe the weird combination of happiness I have at finding a new Glen Arran bottling, combined with the disappointment that it's one of these oddball bottlings. I can't wait to see what they have in store for us, but I'll be happier when it's just a straight bottling.</p>
