    <h1>An Unlikely Hobby</h1>
    
  </header>
  <p>If you tell someone you drink whisky for a hobby, at the very least you'll get a sly smile or a chuckle. It's the same sort of look you'd shoot someone if they said their hobby was off-track betting on horses. Of course we're not alcoholics at Whiskypedia, but we do have more 750ml bottles in the cupboard than most.</p>
<p>There are a couple of reasons why I consider whisky drinking a hobby, rather than an affliction: <em>collection</em> and <em>discernment</em>.</p>
<p>One of the first stages of the single malt whisky hobby is to realize the huge breadth of flavour among whiskies. Like other hobbies involving collections, this phase is categorized by <em>acquisition</em>. You want to sample all the different flavours on offer, to categorize them, and to judge them. Like coins or stamps, once you get over the breadth, you go searching for the rare and the prized. Individual whisky collections often have themes: some collect good value for money, some collect region or flavour, some collect rare malts, while some collect only from independent or mothballed distilleries.</p>
<p>If the goal was merely intoxication, any sufficiently inebriating liquor would do. But there isn't a single malt drinker out there who can't pick favourites. A whisky drinker has <em>discernment</em> about the malts they praise. Not everyone will agree: some value smoothness, others value boldness, but each will have a preference, and will work to identify the attributes that affect their enjoyment the most. It's this identification that elevates a mere preference into a discerning choice. Discernment is about understanding and articulating what makes a whisky more palatable relative to others.</p>
<p>It's unfortunate that alcohol is abused so widely. Just as the high rate of highway deaths colours "sport driving" on public roads, so too will alcoholism affect perception of whisky drinking as a hobby. It's up to each of us to represent our hobby responsibly.</p>
<p><em>(As our own little contribution to temperance, we've decided not to have any more Four Review Thursdays. They rarely produced more than 2 reviews, in any case.)</em></p>

  <p>Bowmore promises the essential Islay peaty, salty character in a smooth, integrated malt.  This delivers the character, but there are non-cask strength malts that do it better.</p>

  <p>A dram worthy of the Bowmore brand and surprisingly smooth at 56%.  So ... don't forget this is cask strength after you've already got a bottle of this limited edition malt.</p>
  </div>
  </div>
  
  <p>Bowmore malts are some of the smoothest Islay malts going.  They're known for combining a beautiful smoothness with almost shocking flavours of phenol, peat smoke, and saltiness.  This malt is a cask strength, coming in at 56%, so expect a bit of rough ride.</p>
<p>The nose has less salt and sea air than you'd expect in a Bowmore.  It's deceptively subtle.</p>
<p>This malt has warming, smooth malty tastes that turn to smoky, peaty saltiness when you swallow.  It's wonderfully integrated.  The finish is long and all peat smoke.  It's slightly less salty than some regular production Bowmores.  But it's also more warming, and coats your throat like a cask strength malt should.</p>
<p>Water reduces the initial burst of flavour, but keeps the essential character.  The finish is still long and peaty.  The flavours are still relatively complex.  Water it down if the cask strength alcohol percentage is too bitey, but this malt is very drinkable straight up.</p>
<p>Bowmore consistently bottles good experiences. They're a cornerstone of the Islay experience.  They're integrated and smooth, all while putting some hair on your chest.  This is no different, and will reward and malt enthusiast with a taste for Islay and cask strength malts.</p>
