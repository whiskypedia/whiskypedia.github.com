    <h1><a href="/blog/2012/04/an-unlikely-hobby.html">An Unlikely Hobby</a></h1>
    
  </header>
  <p>If you tell someone you drink whisky for a hobby, at the very least you'll get a sly smile or a chuckle. It's the same sort of look you'd shoot someone if they said their hobby was off-track betting on horses. Of course we're not alcoholics at Whiskypedia, but we do have more 750ml bottles in the cupboard than most.</p>
<p>There are a couple of reasons why I consider whisky drinking a hobby, rather than an affliction: <em>collection</em> and <em>discernment</em>.</p>
<p>One of the first stages of the single malt whisky hobby is to realize the huge breadth of flavour among whiskies. Like other hobbies involving collections, this phase is categorized by <em>acquisition</em>. You want to sample all the different flavours on offer, to categorize them, and to judge them. Like coins or stamps, once you get over the breadth, you go searching for the rare and the prized. Individual whisky collections often have themes: some collect good value for money, some collect region or flavour, some collect rare malts, while some collect only from independent or mothballed distilleries.</p>
<p>If the goal was merely intoxication, any sufficiently inebriating liquor would do. But there isn't a single malt drinker out there who can't pick favourites. A whisky drinker has <em>discernment</em> about the malts they praise. Not everyone will agree: some value smoothness, others value boldness, but each will have a preference, and will work to identify the attributes that affect their enjoyment the most. It's this identification that elevates a mere preference into a discerning choice. Discernment is about understanding and articulating what makes a whisky more palatable relative to others.</p>
<p>It's unfortunate that alcohol is abused so widely. Just as the high rate of highway deaths colours "sport driving" on public roads, so too will alcoholism affect perception of whisky drinking as a hobby. It's up to each of us to represent our hobby responsibly.</p>
<p><em>(As our own little contribution to temperance, we've decided not to have any more Four Review Thursdays. They rarely produced more than 2 reviews, in any case.)</em></p>

  <p>You should have a highland now and then, and at this price, Aberfeldy 12 shouldn't be missed.</p>

  <p>I'm not going to lie, I picked this up because I had never had an Aberfeldy bottling and it was inexpensive. Its always good to be able to sample a new malt without breaking the bank. And malts often exceed the meagre expectations set by a low price. Aberfeldy 12 is one of those.</p>
<p>Aberfeldy is a highland malt, and has some traditional highland flavours. Like Oban, it's got more of a bite to it than your typical Speyside, although nothing to be concerned about. It's the peat that does it, and that flavour alone keeps up with any bite.</p>
<p>It's a rugged malt. It's not swaddled in sherry; it's not triple-filtered; it's got a long finish to let you know you're drinking a goddamn whisky, not some child's drink. I like highland single malts for this characteristic â€” it's a man's drink, but without the challenge of many Islay malts.</p>
<p>Water doesn't hurt it, but ruins the effect. You pour a glass of highland single malt to remember that you and James Bond are made of the same stuff, barring a few different life choices. Water turns this malt into more of a Speyside experience: there are more subtle flavours, no burn, and a shorter finish. But where's the fun in that?</p>
<p>Aberfeldy doesn't have the cachet to set Macallan-level prices for their malts, and we should all be thankful for that. It's nice to have a pure, less engineered single malt experience, without trick finishes or overpowering sweetness. It's a refreshing change and well worth a look.</p>
