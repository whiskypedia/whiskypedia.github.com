    <h1><a href="/blog/2012/04/an-unlikely-hobby.html">An Unlikely Hobby</a></h1>
    
  </header>
  <p>If you tell someone you drink whisky for a hobby, at the very least you'll get a sly smile or a chuckle. It's the same sort of look you'd shoot someone if they said their hobby was off-track betting on horses. Of course we're not alcoholics at Whiskypedia, but we do have more 750ml bottles in the cupboard than most.</p>
<p>There are a couple of reasons why I consider whisky drinking a hobby, rather than an affliction: <em>collection</em> and <em>discernment</em>.</p>
<p>One of the first stages of the single malt whisky hobby is to realize the huge breadth of flavour among whiskies. Like other hobbies involving collections, this phase is categorized by <em>acquisition</em>. You want to sample all the different flavours on offer, to categorize them, and to judge them. Like coins or stamps, once you get over the breadth, you go searching for the rare and the prized. Individual whisky collections often have themes: some collect good value for money, some collect region or flavour, some collect rare malts, while some collect only from independent or mothballed distilleries.</p>
<p>If the goal was merely intoxication, any sufficiently inebriating liquor would do. But there isn't a single malt drinker out there who can't pick favourites. A whisky drinker has <em>discernment</em> about the malts they praise. Not everyone will agree: some value smoothness, others value boldness, but each will have a preference, and will work to identify the attributes that affect their enjoyment the most. It's this identification that elevates a mere preference into a discerning choice. Discernment is about understanding and articulating what makes a whisky more palatable relative to others.</p>
<p>It's unfortunate that alcohol is abused so widely. Just as the high rate of highway deaths colours "sport driving" on public roads, so too will alcoholism affect perception of whisky drinking as a hobby. It's up to each of us to represent our hobby responsibly.</p>
<p><em>(As our own little contribution to temperance, we've decided not to have any more Four Review Thursdays. They rarely produced more than 2 reviews, in any case.)</em></p>

  <p>Excellently made, but gimmicky. I'd rather have the excellent Glen Arran 10.</p>

  <p>This is an interesting malt to try because there aren't a lot of port cask finished single malts out there. It's part of Glen Arran's line of finishes with no age statement and among them the port finish has to be the oddest.</p>
<p>First, it's a pinky salmon colour. You don't realize how much it's taken for granted that a single malt should be some shade of orange, until it's not. I looked the bottle over for damage or an expiry date to make sure I got the real thing.</p>
<p>Colour aside, this malt packs a punch. It's semi-cask strength at 50%, but not too harsh to drink straight up. And the port finish adds enough flavour to keep up with the alcohol content.</p>
<p>But what about that finish? Port sweetens the malt like sherry, but it doesn't taste like sherry. The port finish has a more tart, grapey flavour to it. I can promise there's no finish like it.</p>
<p>It's an acquired taste. Sherried malts are a dime a dozen, and the more sherried, the less distinctive they are. But this port finish is unique and interesting, if not very familiar. Unfortunately, it's unique and interesting because of the <em>finish</em>, rather than the malt itself. Like sherry, the port takes over the malt, and it becomes all about the finish.</p>
<p>And there's a real shame in that. Glen Arran produces some of the best tasting young malts sold, all without having to drown them in the flavour of some other spirit. The port finish is good because Glen Arran seems incapable of releasing a poor malt, but it's still a gimmick.</p>
<p>That's not to say it's not worth buying. If you're interested in odd finishes slightly off the beaten path, you will enjoy this one.</p>
