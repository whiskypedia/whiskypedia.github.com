    <h1><a href="/blog/2012/04/an-unlikely-hobby.html">An Unlikely Hobby</a></h1>
    
  </header>
  <p>If you tell someone you drink whisky for a hobby, at the very least you'll get a sly smile or a chuckle. It's the same sort of look you'd shoot someone if they said their hobby was off-track betting on horses. Of course we're not alcoholics at Whiskypedia, but we do have more 750ml bottles in the cupboard than most.</p>
<p>There are a couple of reasons why I consider whisky drinking a hobby, rather than an affliction: <em>collection</em> and <em>discernment</em>.</p>
<p>One of the first stages of the single malt whisky hobby is to realize the huge breadth of flavour among whiskies. Like other hobbies involving collections, this phase is categorized by <em>acquisition</em>. You want to sample all the different flavours on offer, to categorize them, and to judge them. Like coins or stamps, once you get over the breadth, you go searching for the rare and the prized. Individual whisky collections often have themes: some collect good value for money, some collect region or flavour, some collect rare malts, while some collect only from independent or mothballed distilleries.</p>
<p>If the goal was merely intoxication, any sufficiently inebriating liquor would do. But there isn't a single malt drinker out there who can't pick favourites. A whisky drinker has <em>discernment</em> about the malts they praise. Not everyone will agree: some value smoothness, others value boldness, but each will have a preference, and will work to identify the attributes that affect their enjoyment the most. It's this identification that elevates a mere preference into a discerning choice. Discernment is about understanding and articulating what makes a whisky more palatable relative to others.</p>
<p>It's unfortunate that alcohol is abused so widely. Just as the high rate of highway deaths colours "sport driving" on public roads, so too will alcoholism affect perception of whisky drinking as a hobby. It's up to each of us to represent our hobby responsibly.</p>
<p><em>(As our own little contribution to temperance, we've decided not to have any more Four Review Thursdays. They rarely produced more than 2 reviews, in any case.)</em></p>

      <p>Laphroaig 18 is the warm, strong, refined older sibling that its 10 year old brother yearns to be.</p>
    </div>
    
    
      </div>
    
  
  <p>Laphroaig is a unique distillery in a field of unique distilleries. The 10 is a real hair-on-your-chest awakener for many new to scotch whisky. It is a little too young and  unintegrated. The promise is evident, but it's not quite there yet. Older distillery bottlings are rarer, but the extra years are often rewarding. Does the 18 hold up?</p>
<p>The nose is characteristically Laphroaig, but tamer than the 10. Underneath the usual phenol, salt, and peat are barely perceptible malty notes. The mouth feel is oily, which is also par for Laphroaig. It coats the mouth and and warms with as much  bite as is appropriate for an 18 year old malt, which is to say not much.</p>
<p>But how does it <em>taste</em>? You're going to get the Laphroaig you want. It's got the phenol. It's got the peat. It's got the sea air. But all of that comes with a mitigating dash of honey. The phenol doesn't cut as much as the 10. There's actually a tiny bit of sweetness to it. Sweetness! It's not Macallan style, hit-over-the-head sweetness. Just a touch, enough to warm it up.</p>
<p>Unlike the 10, the flavours are very well integrated. They play in your mouth, with none taking over. And they're all a little softened. A softer Laphroaig is a little like a cheaper Ferrari. You need to evaluate it among its peers to come to that rather odd conclusion. You still have a Ferrari; it can only be so cheap.</p>
<p>Likewise, softened or not, this will still be the strongest flavoured whisky in your cabinet. It can still be smelled across the room when opened. It will make babies cry and young men choke. It is a genuine Laphroaig.</p>
<p>After a thorough tasting, it's warm and welcome on the tongue. The finish seems to last for days. It's the expected salt and smoke, with a bit of the famous phenol. But there is an unexpected extra! Returning to the nose after a long sampling reveals the delicate malt within. Stripped of the phenol, the maltiness and lighter grassiness pokes through, like a highland malt hidden underneath all the Islay. It's easy to overlook unless you go right back to the nose just after swallowing. Somewhere deep inside this Laphroaig is the heart of a delicate scotch whisky.</p>
<p>It's definitely worth having an older Laphroaig in the cabinet for days that require it, or for guests who haven't had anything stronger than a Glenlivet. Try the 10 on a dare, but keep a bottle of the 18 for the sheer artistry in making a beautiful dram out of such harsh components.</p>
