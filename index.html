    <h1>An Unlikely Hobby</h1>
    
  </header>
  <p>If you tell someone you drink whisky for a hobby, at the very least you'll get a sly smile or a chuckle. It's the same sort of look you'd shoot someone if they said their hobby was off-track betting on horses. Of course we're not alcoholics at Whiskypedia, but we do have more 750ml bottles in the cupboard than most.</p>
<p>There are a couple of reasons why I consider whisky drinking a hobby, rather than an affliction: <em>collection</em> and <em>discernment</em>.</p>
<p>One of the first stages of the single malt whisky hobby is to realize the huge breadth of flavour among whiskies. Like other hobbies involving collections, this phase is categorized by <em>acquisition</em>. You want to sample all the different flavours on offer, to categorize them, and to judge them. Like coins or stamps, once you get over the breadth, you go searching for the rare and the prized. Individual whisky collections often have themes: some collect good value for money, some collect region or flavour, some collect rare malts, while some collect only from independent or mothballed distilleries.</p>
<p>If the goal was merely intoxication, any sufficiently inebriating liquor would do. But there isn't a single malt drinker out there who can't pick favourites. A whisky drinker has <em>discernment</em> about the malts they praise. Not everyone will agree: some value smoothness, others value boldness, but each will have a preference, and will work to identify the attributes that affect their enjoyment the most. It's this identification that elevates a mere preference into a discerning choice. Discernment is about understanding and articulating what makes a whisky more palatable relative to others.</p>
<p>It's unfortunate that alcohol is abused so widely. Just as the high rate of highway deaths colours "sport driving" on public roads, so too will alcoholism affect perception of whisky drinking as a hobby. It's up to each of us to represent our hobby responsibly.</p>
<p><em>(As our own little contribution to temperance, we've decided not to have any more Four Review Thursdays. They rarely produced more than 2 reviews, in any case.)</em></p>

  <p>Too much burning for the price.  For the same type of thing, buy the 10 year old and save the cash.</p>

  <p>Underwhelming.  What was that Malt doing for those 18 years?  Certainly not maturing.</p>
  </div>
  </div>
  
  <p>Auchentoshan is the quintessential lowland malt. The 10 year old has graced the LCBO shelves regularly for years. Unpeated lowlands are generally more delicate than your chest-hair growing Islay malts, so Auchentoshan has been a fantastic gift for ages, especially as an introductory single malt for blend drinkers.</p>
<p>The nose is weak. You have to stick your nose way down into the glass, and then all it offers up is your typical lowland fare: grassy citrus. It gets richer once you’ve had a sip. There’s nothing really distinctive here that you won’t find in another bottling of Auchentoshan, and probably for cheaper.</p>
<p>It's also spicier up front than your typical 18 year old. Relatively tame after half a glass, but still surprising. While starting relatively oily and warming, the blast of “spice” (i.e., burning) dominates the otherwise subtle sweet lemongrass flavour. Water is mandatory to bring out the more delicate flavour.  It pushes any burning off to late into the finish, which means you enjoy each sip for longer.</p>
<p>The finish has a splash of the salty sea air that you get in larger quantities in an Islay malt like a Bowmore. It’s subtle, but there’s so little going on otherwise that it’s notable.  Bowmore owns Auchentoshan, so while they’re hundreds of miles apart, and made in completely separate ways, it’s interesting that they have some tiny thread in common.</p>
