    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Bowmore malts are some of the smoothest Islay malts going.  They&#39;re known for combining a beautiful smoothness with almost shocking flavours of phenol, peat smoke, and saltiness.  This malt is a cask strength, coming in at 56%, so expect a bit of rough ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nose has less salt and sea air than you&#39;d expect in a Bowmore.  It&#39;s deceptively subtle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This malt has warming, smooth malty tastes that turn to smoky, peaty saltiness when you swallow.  It&#39;s wonderfully integrated.  The finish is long and all peat smoke.  It&#39;s slightly less salty than some regular production Bowmores.  But it&#39;s also more warming, and coats your throat like a cask strength malt should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water reduces the initial burst of flavour, but keeps the essential character.  The finish is still long and peaty.  The flavours are still relatively complex.  Water it down if the cask strength alcohol percentage is too bitey, but this malt is very drinkable straight up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bowmore consistently bottles good experiences. They&#39;re a cornerstone of the Islay experience.  They&#39;re integrated and smooth, all while putting some hair on your chest.  This is no different, and will reward and malt enthusiast with a taste for Islay and cask strength malts.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Aberlour A'bunadh Review</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A&#39;bunadh is gaelic for &#34;of the origin&#34;. We&#39;ve taken to amiably calling this malt &#34;Origin&#34;. Aberlour&#39;s made a brilliant no-age-statement, sherry finished cask strength powershouse (60.4% alcohol in this batch).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you notice about this malt is the deep reddish brown colour.  It&#39;s darker and redder than almost any malt on the market. The nose is dominated by all the sherry cask elements: molasses, sugar, and sweetness.  The more subtle traces are still &#34;big&#34; flavours: dark fruits like black cherry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 60% alcohol, this is going to pack a punch, no matter what you do.  Aberlour has jammed such strength of flavour in the remaining 40% that they manage to take over from the pure alcohol, and give the malt a life beyond the initial burn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most distinctive part of this malt is that the inherent flavours of the malt are not over-powered by the alcohol content. Cask strength malts are valued by enthusiasts because the malt is close to the pure level of the cask. For modern production bottles, the bottler has already diluted the malt with water to 40%, but not cask strength malts. They retain the original characteristic of the malt straight from the cask.  The trade-off is that you usually cut the malt with water to your own taste. A seasoned scotch drinker can enjoy Origin uncut, although we do recommend you do so with care. It hits like a truck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding water makes this malt dangerously good. If you add enough water to reduce the alcohol content down to normal levels, the drink becomes more tractable. Both the intense flavour and the burn are relieved, but in good proportion: it&#39;s a smoother drink where the sweet, big flavours still overwhelm any trace of alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The finish is long and warming. It is a perfect winter malt because of the warming. Any trace of burn disappears, and it leaves a sweet, warm bit of comfort that radiates down the throat. It&#39;s a brandy experience, leaving you with a glow that lasts a few minutes with each sip.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Talisker 10 Review</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Islay-like with some extra sweetness. Big, salty, peaty, and wonderfully complex. This is a must-try malt that will put some hair on your chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nose is mainly peat smoke, leather, sea air. You&#39;ll smell it well before the glass gets to your nose. This is not some delicate Speyside you have to stick your nose in the glass to smell. It&#39;s a blast of phenolic sea air. Much like an Islay. Which isn&#39;t surprising since it&#39;s made on the Isle of Skye, just north of Islay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first sip is a fireball of flavours. It&#39;s a ten-year old, so expect an initial spiciness before you settle into it. But the flavours are big all the way to the end of the glass. The flavour has a syrupy sweetness, and malty taste that&#39;s hard to hold onto, since your nose will register the salt and peat smoke. It&#39;s a very complex malt, as every sip will go through all these stages of development. The smokiness and sea air come through the nose, and last forever. You&#39;re not going to kiss your wife right after a taste of this malt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water dilutes the nose and the initial spiciness. It becomes a sweeter drink and keeps the long finish of smoke and sea air. It&#39;s a milder way to get that long finish. But it&#39;s also loses some of the complexity of the development, so we prefer this malt without the water.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Aberlour 10 Review</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re looking for a straightforward Speyside malt with strong expressions of vanilla and sherry, this is a great choice with a great price tag. It&#39;s not sophisticated like other Speysides, but it&#39;s warm and comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nose is sweet like bourbon, but not a sherry bomb. It has a medium body, but medium in a good way. Sweet without being too sweet. Long lasting but not oily. Medium in the way of being balanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not a fan of saying that there are &#34;hints of&#34; anything, since that&#39;s usually code for a tasting snob. Like: &#34;hints of tulip petals&#34; or &#34;hints of Paris in the spring&#34;. But this malt has hints of vanilla. Not an outright flavour, more like a reminder of vanilla. This is common in bourbon casked malts, and this particular malt is a good expression of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dominant flavours are vanilla, sherry and a mild spiciness. Without water, the sherry gets in the way of the more subtle flavours that you find in Speyside malt. The delicate floral flavours might be in there, but it&#39;s too hidden with the bitey character of any 10-year old and the sweetness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water takes most of the sweet out of it, but leaves the bare malt. It isn&#39;t replaced with flowers that you&#39;d expect from a more sophisticated Speyside. This malt doesn&#39;t need any water, and it doesn&#39;t help. Drink this straight up and enjoy it for what it is.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
