    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to our humble spot on the Internet, where single malts are enjoyed and demystified. Blends are enjoyed too, but you&#39;re not supposed to admit that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Are We Here&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons that we&#39;re writing this site. They&#39;re all correct, even though none are the single reason:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got tired of snooty whisky reviews claiming all sorts of smells, tastes, and experiences that no regular person would ever taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got annoyed by whisky snobs, who would like to keep single malts only available to the &#34;initiated&#34;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted to give some sort of justification to the continued abuse of our livers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s all of these, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Real Reviews For Real People&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we&#39;re going into the depths of malt whiskies, and we&#39;re going to write reviews that regular people would recognize. We want people to buy a malt and know what they&#39;re actually getting. We&#39;d like people to be able to pick a small stable of whiskies to be prepared for all occasions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to demystify the world of whisky, especially single malt Scotch whisky.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
